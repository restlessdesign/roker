# Roker

A clean and simple weather dashboard that displays the current temperature and conditions, daily high and low, and a rolling hourly forecase for the next 12 hours.

This was initially designed as a full-screen dashboard meant to run on a Raspberry Pi hooked up to a 9" display, but feel free to use to your liking!

## Installation

You must first acquire an API key from Weather Underground. Once you have that, edit `index.html` to include your key.

This project currently assumes that are capable of deploying this code to a web server (remote or local). Future versions may include a script to run a local server out-of-the-box.
